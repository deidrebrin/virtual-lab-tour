# Instructions for taking the 360 photographs

## Connecting your phone to the camera
1. Install the Samsung Gear 360 app (white with orange font)
2. Follow the instructions to connect to the camera (Connection guide) on the screen when you first open the app (you can also get back to this by tapping Get Connected and then Connection Guide).
3. When the name and password appears on the camera screen, copy down both (name will be something like Gear 360[####] and the password should be a string of numbers) - you'll need to enter it on your phone.

### Once connected
1. Click on Camera
2. Make sure the icon just above Mode on the bottom left is set to Dual and the icon on the right is set to 360 view.
3. You can use the Mode button to select Video or photo - I had the best luck with Landscape HDR but try a few just in case!
4. You can do some basic adjustments using the icons at the top.
5. Set the camera up where you want it then hide and take the photosðŸ™‚

## Saving images
1. Go back to the first screen in the app and open the Gallery
2. Click on Select and then select all of the images/videos you want to download. Tap save
3. By saving through the app, it will stitch the front and rear photos together into a 360 view!
4. Upload or email me the image you want to use for the lab!
