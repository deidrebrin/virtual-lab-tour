# virtual-lab-tour

Explore the UCLA Cotsen Institute of Archaeology labs - virtually! This repository is the codebase for a simple virtual tour with 360 photos using Pannellum. Each lab has additional information and media provided through popups.

## Set up your own virtual tour

You can use this repository to create your own virtual tour. You'll need access to a webserver and a basic understanding of HTML & CSS but a template guide and instructions are provided in the docs directory to help you get started.
